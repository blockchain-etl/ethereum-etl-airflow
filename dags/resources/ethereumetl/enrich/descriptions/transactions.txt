Each block in the blockchain is composed of zero or more transactions. Each transaction has a source address, a target address, an amount of Ether transferred, and an array of input bytes.
This table contains a set of all transactions from all blocks, and contains a block identifier to get associated block-specific information associated with each transaction.
